A simple yet powerful implementation of the Quadratic Formula written entirely in Assembly.
This program computes the real roots of a quadratic equation of the form:

ax2+bx+c=0
â€‹

ðŸš€ Features

Written in pure Assembly (x86).

Computes real roots of quadratic equations.

Handles edge cases such as:

a=0/1 (not a quadratic equation)

Negative discriminants (no real roots)

Optimized for readability and performance.
